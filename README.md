# vuejs-blog

In this project I have stepped into the Vue.js world. Though I have been dealing with the React.js almost 2 years, I have really enjoyed to learn about Vue.js.

The things that I practised about Vue in this project:

- data & methods properties
- data binding & 2-way data binding
- events & event modifiers 
- computed properties
- dynamic css classes & css scope
- conditional rendering
- looping with v-for
- vue CLI & vue files & root component
- nesting components
- props
- events (child to parent) & event bus
- life cycle hooks
- slots 
- dynamic components
- input & checkbox & selectbox binding
- http requests
- custom directives/filters on global/local level
- mixins
- routing hash/history type routing & router links and router view
- route parameters
- firebase realtime database integration

#### Libraries/Frameworks

- vue: JS framework v2.5
- vue-router: The router plugin for Vue.js
- vue-resource: Web request plugin for Vue.js
